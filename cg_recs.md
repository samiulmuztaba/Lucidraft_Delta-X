Since this isn’t *Lucidraft Delta-X* but a **vote-winning MVP**, you need to pick features that are:

* **High visual impact** (wow factor in 5 seconds)
* **Low dev time** (done in < 3 hrs each)
* **Easy to show in a demo** (no long explanations needed)

Here’s the **shortlist** I’d go with:

---

**1️⃣ Rich-colored CLI interface** *(\~2 hrs)*

* Use `rich` to format results in tables, panels, and color highlights.
* Example:

```text
🚀 Lucidraft v1.3 — Model Comparison
────────────────────────────────────────────
🏆 Winner: Skyhawk-X (Distance 18.4m, Stability 93%)
📊 Distance:  ██████████ 18.4m
📊 Stability: ████████   93%
────────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

**2️⃣ Badges & witty performance messages** *(\~2 hrs)*

* Award badges like “Distance Demon” or “Stability Samurai” based on performance.
* Example output:

```text
🥇 New Personal Record! Distance Demon Badge unlocked!
```

---

**3️⃣ Instant visual comparison chart** *(\~3 hrs)*

* Use `matplotlib` or ASCII bars to compare latest model vs. previous.
* Makes improvements obvious at a glance.
* Example:

```
Distance:
Prev ████████ 16.2m
New  ██████████ 18.4m
```

---

**4️⃣ Auto-save & shareable results** *(\~2 hrs)*

* Export each test run as a neat CSV or JSON.
* Lets users screenshot or share leaderboards.

---

**5️⃣ Quick “drift detection”** *(\~3 hrs)* *(optional)*

* If you already analyze flight path, detect if plane leans left/right and display fun comment:

```text
🛩️ Your plane drifted right by 6°. Try adjusting the wing fold!
```

---

**Total time:** **\~9 hrs** for core 4 features
(+3 hrs if you want drift detection too)

---

If you nail **#1, #2, and #3**, you’ll already have a **flashy, fun, memorable demo** without overbuilding.

I can design a **mocked-up CLI output** for Lucidraft with these features so you see exactly how it’ll look in the demo.
